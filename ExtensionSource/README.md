## Building locally

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 14
    - If you are using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (recommended) running `nvm use` will automatically choose the right node version for you.
- Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
- Install dependencies: `yarn setup` (not the usual install command)
- Copy the `.metamaskrc.dist` file to `.metamaskrc`
    - Replace the `INFURA_PROJECT_ID` value with your own personal [Infura Project ID](https://infura.io/docs).
    - If debugging MetaMetrics, you'll need to add a value for `SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY` [Segment write key](https://segment.com/docs/connections/find-writekey/).
- Build the project to the `./dist/` folder with `yarn dist`.

Uncompressed builds can be found in `/dist`, compressed builds can be found in `/builds` once they're built.

See the [build system readme](./development/build/README.md) for build system usage information.

### Development builds

To start a development build (e.g. with logging and file watching) run `yarn start`.

#### React and Redux DevTools

To start the [React DevTools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools), run `yarn devtools:react` with a development build installed in a browser. This will open in a separate window; no browser extension is required.

To start the [Redux DevTools Extension](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools/tree/main/extension):
- Install the package `remotedev-server` globally (e.g. `yarn global add remotedev-server`)
- Install the Redux Devtools extension.
- Open the Redux DevTools extension and check the "Use custom (local) server" checkbox in the Remote DevTools Settings, using the default server configuration (host `localhost`, port `8000`, secure connection checkbox unchecked).

Then run the command `yarn devtools:redux` with a development build installed in a browser. This will enable you to use the Redux DevTools extension to inspect MetaMask.

To create a development build and run both of these tools simultaneously, run `yarn start:dev`.

#### Test Dapp

[This test site](https://metamask.github.io/test-dapp/) can be used to execute different user flows.

### Running Unit Tests and Linting

Run unit tests and the linter with `yarn test`. To run just unit tests, run `yarn test:unit`.

You can run the linter by itself with `yarn lint`, and you can automatically fix some lint problems with `yarn lint:fix`. You can also run these two commands just on your local changes to save time with `yarn lint:changed` and `yarn lint:changed:fix` respectively.

### Running E2E Tests

Our e2e test suite can be run on either Firefox or Chrome. In either case, start by creating a test build by running `yarn build:test`.

Firefox e2e tests can be run with `yarn test:e2e:firefox`.

Chrome e2e tests can be run with `yarn test:e2e:chrome`, but they will only work if you have Chrome v79 installed. Update the `chromedriver` package to a version matching your local Chrome installation to run e2e tests on newer Chrome versions.

### Changing dependencies

Whenever you change dependencies (adding, removing, or updating, either in `package.json` or `yarn.lock`), there are various files that must be kept up-to-date.

* `yarn.lock`:
  * Run `yarn setup` again after your changes to ensure `yarn.lock` has been properly updated.
  * Run `yarn yarn-deduplicate` to remove duplicate dependencies from the lockfile.
* The `allow-scripts` configuration in `package.json`
  * Run `yarn allow-scripts auto` to update the `allow-scripts` configuration automatically. This config determines whether the package's install/postinstall scripts are allowed to run. Review each new package to determine whether the install script needs to run or not, testing if necessary.
  * Unfortunately, `yarn allow-scripts auto` will behave inconsistently on different platforms. macOS and Windows users may see extraneous changes relating to optional dependencies.
* The LavaMoat policy files. The _tl;dr_ is to run `yarn lavamoat:auto` to update these files, but there can be devils in the details. Continue reading for more information.
  * There are two sets of LavaMoat policy files:
    * The production LavaMoat policy files (`lavamoat/browserify/*/policy.json`), which are re-generated using `yarn lavamoat:background:auto`.
      * These should be regenerated whenever the production dependencies for the background change.
    * The build system LavaMoat policy file (`lavamoat/build-system/policy.json`), which is re-generated using `yarn lavamoat:build:auto`.
      * This should be regenerated whenever the dependencies used by the build system itself change.
  * Whenever you regenerate a policy file, review the changes to determine whether the access granted to each package seems appropriate.
  * Unfortunately, `yarn lavamoat:auto` will behave inconsistently on different platforms.
  macOS and Windows users may see extraneous changes relating to optional dependencies.
  * Keep in mind that any kind of dynamic import or dynamic use of globals may elude LavaMoat's static analysis.
  Refer to the LavaMoat documentation or ask for help if you run into any issues.
